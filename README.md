# Web app that controls a half-y matrix switcher for my home stereo

I'm using an AutoPatch half-y matrix switcher that has 8 inputs and 4 outputs.
The half-y is controlled over a USB serial adapter with pySerial.
The control interface is a simple responsive web app built with Flask, Jinja2 templates, and Skeleton.

### Config file format:

The config file is called config.json and is located in the same directory as multi-read.py
It follows the following format outline:

'''json
{
    "device_name":"/dev/ttyUSB0",
    "inputs":{
        "1":"Line In",
        "3":"Laptop"
    },
    "outputs":{
        "1":"Living Room",
        "4":"Kitchen"
    },
    "level":"1",
    "log_level":"Debug",
    "log_file":""
}
'''
